## Demo Functionality

The demo provides a user-friendly interface to simulate the "Learning from Ants" lunar waste recycling system.  It allows users to experiment with different parameters and observe the system's behavior.

**Key Features:**

* **Lunar Base Population Control:** Adjust the number of inhabitants in the lunar base to see how it affects resource requirements and waste generation.

* **Waste Generation Control:** Modify the amount of waste generated for each waste category to simulate different scenarios.

* **Bioreactor Control:**  Manually adjust the parameters of each bioreactor, controlling the recycling process and resource production.  Observe how changes in one bioreactor affect the overall system.

* **Lunar Base Location Selection:** Choose from different lunar locations designated by NASA.  This selection will dynamically update environmental parameters like temperature and solar exposure, influencing the efficiency and operation of the system.

* **AI-Powered Autonomous Management:** The core feature of the demo is the AI management button.  Clicking this button activates the intelligent control system, which automatically adjusts the bioreactor parameters to:
    * Efficiently recycle all waste.
    * Produce the necessary resources (fuel, energy, heat, food, oxygen, water) to maintain a comfortable and sustainable environment for the lunar base inhabitants.
    * Optimize resource utilization and minimize waste.

* **Real-time Monitoring:** Observe in real-time how the AI manages the system, adjusting bioreactor parameters and resource production to meet the needs of the lunar base.

## Using the Demo

1. **Access the demo** by clicking the link provided above.

2. **Experiment with the parameters:** Change the number of inhabitants, waste amounts, and bioreactor settings to explore different scenarios.

3. **Activate the AI:** Click the AI management button to observe the autonomous control system in action.

4. **Observe the Results:** Monitor the resource levels, waste processing, and overall system performance as the AI manages the system.


This interactive demo provides a compelling visualization of the "Learning from Ants" project, demonstrating its capabilities and potential for sustainable waste recycling and resource generation in lunar colonies.
