## 3. Recycling and Manufacturing Process

**3.1 Waste Categories and Items Addressed:**

Our digital twin addresses the following waste categories and items, prioritizing those with higher mass and volume percentages to maximize resource recovery and impact:

* **Foam Packaging (90% by mass, 100% by volume):** Zotek F30 (100%). This represents a significant volume of waste and provides a valuable feedstock for certain processes.  Zotek F30 is primarily composed of a  polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) copolymer foam.

* **Fabrics (85% by mass, 90% by volume):** Clothing (60%), Washcloths (25%).  This category presents a significant opportunity for recycling due to its relatively high mass. The primary materials are cotton/cellulose and polyester.  We have excluded Disinfectant Wipes due to the complexity of dealing with the high moisture content and potential chemical contamination in the current iteration of our digital twin.

* **Food Packaging (75% by mass, 80% by volume):** Overwrap (40%), Rehydratable Pouches (20%), Drink Pouches (15%). We prioritize these items due to their combined mass and the potential to recover valuable materials like aluminum and polymers. The main materials involved are polyester, polyethylene, aluminum, nylon, and ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH).

* **Other Packaging and Gloves (60% by mass, 70% by volume):** Air Cushion (10%), Bubble Wrap Filler (5%), Reclosable Bags (15%), Anti-Static Bubble Wrap Bags (15%), Plastazote LD45R (15%).  While individually these items represent smaller mass percentages, their combined volume and potential for polymer recovery make them a worthwhile target. These items are primarily composed of polyethylene and, in the case of Nitrile Gloves, nitrile rubber.  We have excluded Nitrile Gloves in this iteration due to the challenges posed by the distinct chemical composition of nitrile rubber compared to the other polymers.

* **Structural Elements (50% by mass, 60% by volume):** Aluminum structure/struts (80%), Polymer matrix composites (20%).  Recovering aluminum is a high priority, despite the lower recycling percentage we've currently achieved in our digital twin. Polymer matrix composites are also targeted due to the value of carbon fiber.

* **EVA Waste (40% by mass, 50% by volume):** Cargo Transfer Bags (CTBS) (100%). Although representing a smaller portion of the overall waste, recovering the Nomex from the CTBS presents a valuable opportunity due to its high performance characteristics.

These percentages reflect the current capabilities of our digital twin and are subject to improvement in future iterations.  We have prioritized items based on their mass and volume contributions and the potential for recovering valuable materials. Our focus is on developing a flexible and adaptable system that can handle the diverse waste stream of a lunar colony.

Our digital twin focuses on the following waste categories:
